  life. That is why we decided to investigate the potential racial disparity

  Are People of Color affected worse by the pandemic than Caucasian people.
  This question, being as broad as it is, led to two additional questions that
  make up the basis of our investigation: Which racial group was hit the hardest
  (most deaths)? In what state is it the worst for People of Color? As you
  investigate this  data for yourself among the following pages, consider the
  questions that we wonder about but can't have concrete answers to: WHY Is
  there a correlation between higher deaths and a particular racial group in
  any given state? What systems need to improve to 'level the playing field'
  as far as health care is concerned? And most pressingly, how are we going
  to protect lives throughout the remainder of this pandemic? With all that

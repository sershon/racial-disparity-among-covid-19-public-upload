## Third Takeaway
An insight our team found was that the perception afforded from data can vary depending on how data is analyzed and visualized. For example, while one pie chart showing COVID-19 disparities by race across the United States showed those identifying as white have the highest disparity, a bar chart showing deaths of those identifying as white compared to PoC (People of Color) in New York showed PoC were impacted significantly more. **The broad implication of this insight is to remember that data is fundamentally limited and can be analyzed in various ways that can result in contrasting insights.**

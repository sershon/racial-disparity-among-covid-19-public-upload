"Sources"
"KFF analysis of The COVID Tracking Project, COVID Racial Data Tracker. Data extracted from state websites on November 8, 2020. Total State Population Distribution by Race/Ethnicity based on KFF analysis of 2018 American Community Survey."

"Definitions"
"*NR: Data are not reported on the state website"
""
"*NA: Data are insufficient for total population comparison."

"Notes"
"Percent of cases and/or deaths in each state may not sum to 100% due to rounding. Percentages are based on a total of all probable and confirmed cases and deaths for which race/ethnicity is known. Shares of cases and deaths may not be directly comparable due to differences in reporting periods. Some states report data on cases and deaths for Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander individuals, but data are insufficient for comparisons to total population distribution. "
""
"% of Cases/Deaths Missing Race/Ethnicity Data is the share of total cases/deaths reported in a state for which race/ethnicity is not known. Some states do not update race/ethnicity information as frequently as the count of total cases/deaths for that state, which may increase the % of Cases/Deaths Missing Race/Ethnicity Data."
""
"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. States vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals from race categories. States that include Hispanic individuals in race categories are indicated by a ""Yes"" in the ""Race Categories Include Hispanic Individuals"" column. In the other states, these groups only include non-Hispanic individuals."


Footnotes
"1. The percent of deaths among Hispanic people in AR is based on the total deaths rather than deaths with known race/ethnicity; the AR state website does not provide information on deaths with unknown ethnicity or deaths among non-Hispanic individuals."
"2. New York death data reporting on the state website excludes New York City. The COVID Tracking Project combines death counts for New York City and New York (excluding New York City), which are reported in separately and may have different reporting periods. New York City data is collected from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene GitHub repository: https://github.com/nychealth"
"3. Individuals may identify as more than one race or ethnicity; totals may not sum to 100%. Population estimates are based on exclusive race categories, and should not be compared to the share cases/deaths."
